# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.

#Removed minima theme as we are now using a 'regular' theme, i.e. we copied the _includes, _layouts, _sass, and _assets folders from the Ruby Gem folder over to this project. Did "bundle update" after editing this file and the yaml file in relation to this change.

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
